# Unsupervised Edge Segmentation CNN

This Edge Detector CNN model it has been built taking inspiration from the [Ruohui Wang's](http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783319406626-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1575688-p180031493) paper. 
Is a Convolutional Neural Network  that perform and  edge detection. This Neural Network is trained through the help of canny edge detector that assist the patch extraction task allowing to label as edge all patches of size 23x23 that present a certain score when evaluated through a 'count_center' function that all sums feature inside the 3x3 square cetered at the patch center.
The three input channel to each patch is composed by the grayscale negative brain image at first place, the grayscale filtered image at second place,  and the laplace filtered image at third place. The wollowing choice it has been made in order to simplify the pattern research of t
